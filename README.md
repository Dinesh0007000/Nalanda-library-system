# Nalanda Library Management System â€“ Backend

## Overview
The **Nalanda Library Management System** is a backend application built with **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and GraphQL**.  
It provides both **RESTful APIs** and **GraphQL APIs** to manage users, books, borrowing operations, and generate reports.

**Highlights**
- **JWT-based authentication with JWE encryption**
- **Role-based access control** (Admin & Member)
- **Comprehensive Postman test suite** (24 test cases)

##  Setup Instructions


```
1.Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Dinesh0007000/Nalanda-library-system
cd Nalanda-library-system

2.Install Dependencies
npm install

3.Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root with the following values:
env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret-key>
JWE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32-byte-base64-encryption-key>

Generate a secure 32-byte Base64 key for JWE_ENCRYPTION_KEY:
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"

Example .env:
env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/nalanda
JWT_SECRET=mysecretkey123
JWE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=randombase64keyexample
